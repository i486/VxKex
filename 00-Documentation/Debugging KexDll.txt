KexDll is not 100% straightforward to debug, since it executes prior to most
other DllMain's and prior to the main exe's entry point.

However, WinDbg (part of Debugging Tools for Windows, found in the SDK) can
easily debug its code by following these steps:

  1. Start an application in WinDbg by File->Open Executable.
  2. Type in the command window: "bu KexDll!DllMain" (or any other function)
  3. Re-start the application by Debug->Restart.

Then, WinDbg will break at any specified function in KexDll and can display
source code, variables, call stack, etc.
