The program which installs VxKex on user computers is called KexSetup and its
source code can be found in the main solution. The responsibilities of this
program include:

  - creating an installation folder inside Program files (or another user
    selected location)

  - creating registry keys and values:

      \Registry\Machine\Software\VXsoft\VxKex
	    InstalledVersion (REG_DWORD)
		KexDir (REG_SZ)
		LogDir (REG_SZ)

	  \Registry\User\Software\VXsoft\VxKex
	    LogDir (REG_SZ) (overrides the HKLM value, if present)

  - placing KexDll into system32

  - placing auxiliary files and programs, such as the log viewer, the
    configuration helper program KexCfg, and the shell extension KexShlEx
	into the VxKex installation folder (known as KexDir within the code)

  - placing the system extension DLLs (kxbase, kxuser, etc.) into KexDir

  - registering the VxKex property sheet page shell extension

  - associating .vxl file extension with VxlView

Of course, the program can also uninstall VxKex and must reverse all the above
procedures when doing so.
