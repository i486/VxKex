Information in this file is based on analysis of Windows 7 SP1 and also
Windows 7 with all latest ESU updates. May not be 100% compatible with all
Win7 builds; if widespread usage is intended, further study is up to the
reader.

WOW64 Note: On Windows 7 and above, the Image File Execution Options key is
shared for 32-bit and 64-bit processes. There is no need to worry about
WOW64 registry redirection for the IFEO key on Windows 7.


The following values are meaningful to Windows 7 when under the IFEO root:

DevOverrideEnabled
  Allows .local redirection for all .exes.

The following values are meaningful to Windows 7 when under an IFEO exe key:

== kernel32!CreateProcessInternalW ==

Debugger

== kernel32!BaseDllInitialize ==

SearchPathMode
  passed directly to SetSearchPathMode() on dll init

== ntdll!RtlpProcessIFEOKeyFilter ==

FilterFullPath
  It's fine to use a Win32 path for this value.

UseFilter

== ntdll!LdrpInitializeExecutionOptions ==

GlobalFlag(*)
  This value ends up in Peb->NtGlobalFlag.
  See FLG_* in NtDll.h

CWDIllegalInDllSearch
  0xFFFFFFFF - Remove the current working directory from the default DLL search order
  0x00000001 - Blocks a DLL load from the current working directory if the CWD is a WebDAV folder
  0x00000002 - Blocks a DLL load from the current working directory if the CWD is a remote folder

DisableHeapLookaside

ShutdownFlags
  This value is checked by ntdll!RtlDetectHeapLeaks upon proper process
  shutdown (i.e. not terminated forcibly).
  Possible values are a combination of INSPECT_LEAKS and BREAK_ON_LEAKS
  defined in NtDll.h.

PageHeapFlags(*)

== ntdll!AVrfInitializeVerifier ==

VerifierFlags(*)
  See RTL_VRF_FLG_*.
  Set to 0x80000000 to disable page heap (which is slow as balls).

HandleTraces(*)

VerifierDebug(*)
  Various flags which control debug printing.
  See AVRF_DBG_* in NtDll.h

== verifier!AVrfpMiniLoadAttach == (only when avrf enabled of course)

(*) - Any value thus marked is able to be read from HKCU ifeo key
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options)
in addition to the normal one in HKLM, but ONLY if SharedUserData->ImageFileExecutionOptions
has the low-order bit set to 1.

The Microsoft documentation for the verifier.dll function "VerifierIsPerUserSettingsEnabled"
says that we should set a DWORD registry value "ImageExecutionOptions" in the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager to 1, and then the kernel
will set the appropriate value in SharedUserData.

Usually this would be a good thing for VxKex because we wouldn't have to ask for admin
permissions to change configs, but unfortunately the AVrfOpenCurrentUserImageFileOptionsKey
routine in ntdll doesn't respect the "IFEO key filter" mechanism implemented in
RtlpProcessIFEOKeyFilter. Therefore all of our configuration must be stored in the HKLM
ifeo key.
