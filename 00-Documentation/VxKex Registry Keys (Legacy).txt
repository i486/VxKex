Legacy versions of VxKex (0.0.0.3 and prior) used the registry in the following manner:

HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options (key)
  <EXE base name> (key)
    Debugger (REG_SZ)
	  This string would contain "VxKexLdr.exe" somewhere in it.

HKLM\Software\VXsoft\VxKexLdr (key)
  InstalledVersion (REG_DWORD)
  KexDir (REG_SZ)

HKCU\Software\VXsoft\VxKexLdr (key)
  Image File Execution Options (key)
    <tree structure>

In order to remove traces of legacy VxKex from the registry, delete the following keys:

  HKLM\Software\VXsoft\VxKexLdr
  HKCU\Software\VXsoft\VxKexLdr
  Any IFEO key that contains a "Debugger" value that has VxKexLdr.exe in it
